		<p>About ABS Plastic<br>
			Process: Fused Deposition Modeling<br>
			Main Benefits: Fast Turnaround, Good General-Purpose Prototypes</p>

			<hr>

			<p>This hard, sturdy material is ideal for quick general prototyping and confirmation of form, fit, and function. ABS Plastic parts are accurate and consistent, however part surfaces do show visible build lines, especially along organically curved surfaces. Build lines can be sanded away, but if you require clean and smooth surfaces for mold-making or presentation purposes without needing to hand-finish parts, SLA Resin is recommended.</p>

			<p>Choose ABS Plastic if you want quick turnaround on quality plastic prototypes for any general purpose. Not recommended for small figurines or parts with thin unsupported features under 2mm.</p>
